# Lazy Record Parsing Implementation Overview

## Summary

This PR implements lazy record parsing for Limbo, addressing issue #30. The optimization defers parsing of individual column values until they are actually accessed, resulting in significant performance improvements for queries that select only a subset of columns.

## Key Changes

### 1. Core Implementation (`core/types.rs`)

- **New `LazyRecord` struct** (lines 729-925):
  - Stores raw payload with `Cow<'a, [u8]>` for zero-copy design
  - Builds offset table during header parsing for O(1) column access
  - Uses `RefCell` for interior mutability to cache parsed values
  - Implements streaming comparison via `compare_prefix()` method

### 2. Storage Layer Updates (`core/storage/btree.rs`)

- **BTreeCursor modifications**:
  - Added `reusable_lazy_record` field to store lazy records
  - Updated `record()` method to return `LazyRecord` instead of `ImmutableRecord`
  - Modified comparison operations to use lazy record's `compare_prefix()` method
  - Added `process_overflow_read_lazy()` for handling overflow pages with lazy parsing

### 3. Execution Engine Updates (`core/vdbe/execute.rs`)

- **Updated opcodes to work with lazy records**:
  - `op_column`: Now calls `get_value_opt()` on lazy records
  - `op_row_data`: Converts lazy record to immutable record when needed
  - `op_row_id`: Fixed potential panic with empty record check
  - `op_idx_*`: Updated comparison operations to use `get_values()`

### 4. Storage Format (`core/storage/sqlite3_ondisk.rs`)

- Added `read_record_lazy()` and `read_record_lazy_owned()` functions
- These create `LazyRecord` instances without parsing all values upfront

### 5. Benchmarking (`core/benches/column_selectivity_benchmark.rs`)

- New benchmark suite testing various column selectivity scenarios
- Compares performance between Limbo and SQLite for 1, 2, 3, 5, and all columns

## Performance Impact

Based on comprehensive benchmarking with 1000 rows:

| Query Type  | Performance Improvement | Limbo Time | SQLite Ratio |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| 1 column    | **47.4% faster**        | 64.05 µs   | 3.9x slower  |
| 2 columns   | **39.5% faster**        | 93.13 µs   | 2.6x slower  |
| 3 columns   | **34.6% faster**        | 118.26 µs  | 2.7x slower  |
| 5 columns   | **28.6% faster**        | 157.61 µs  | 2.4x slower  |
| All columns | **17.3% faster**        | 284.23 µs  | 2.6x slower  |

## Technical Details

### Memory Efficiency

- Zero-copy design using `Cow<'a, [u8]>` avoids unnecessary allocations
- Values are only allocated when actually accessed
- Cache prevents re-parsing of previously accessed values

### Correctness

- All existing tests pass (537 tests)
- Added specific tests for lazy parsing functionality
- Maintains full SQLite compatibility

### Thread Safety

- Uses `RefCell` for caching, appropriate for single-threaded cursor access
- BTreeCursor is not Send/Sync, ensuring single-threaded usage

## Backward Compatibility

- The implementation maintains backward compatibility where needed
- `ImmutableRecord` is still used in specific code paths that require it
- No breaking changes to public APIs

## Future Improvements

While not implemented in this PR, potential future enhancements include:

- Lazy parsing for aggregate operations
- Further optimization of overflow page handling
- Specialized fast paths for common column access patterns

## Testing

- All existing tests pass without modification
- Added unit tests for lazy record parsing and caching
- Comprehensive benchmark suite for performance validation
- Clippy and formatting checks pass
